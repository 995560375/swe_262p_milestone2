# MSWE 262P Project

## Milestone3
- In this project, we add a overload method at src/main/java/org.json/XML.java. The method signatures are as follows:
- public static JSONObject toJSONObject(Reader reader, Function<String, String> changeString)

- We have made modifications to the original parse function and renamed it to "parseAndModify". This change allows us to modify the key while parsing the XML file directly, unlike the original method, which requires parsing the XML file completely and converting it into a JsonObject before changing the key. The milestone1 approach requires traversing the file(json) twice, making it less time-efficient. However, with our modified parse function, we can accomplish the same task in a single traversal of the file, resulting in a more efficient solution.

# Overview

[JSON](http://www.JSON.org/) is a light-weight language-independent data interchange format.

The JSON-Java package is a reference implementation that demonstrates how to parse JSON documents into Java objects and how to generate new JSON documents from the Java classes.

Project goals include:
* Reliable and consistent results
* Adherence to the JSON specification 
* Easy to build, use, and include in other projects
* No external dependencies
* Fast execution and low memory footprint
* Maintain backward compatibility
* Designed and tested to use on Java versions 1.6 - 1.11

The files in this package implement JSON encoders and decoders. The package can also convert between JSON and XML, HTTP headers, Cookies, and CDL.

For more information on contributions, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Bug fixes, code improvements, and unit test coverage changes are welcome! Because this project is currently in the maintenance phase, the kinds of changes that can be accepted are limited. For more information, please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/wiki/FAQ).

# Build Instructions

The org.json package can be built from the command line, Maven, and Gradle. The unit tests can be executed from Maven, Gradle, or individually in an IDE e.g. Eclipse.
 
**Building from the command line**

*Build the class files from the package root directory src/main/java*
````
javac org/json/*.java
````

*Create the jar file in the current directory*
````
jar cf json-java.jar org/json/*.class
````

*Compile a program that uses the jar (see example code below)*
````
javac -cp .;json-java.jar Test.java (Windows)
javac -cp .:json-java.jar Test.java (Unix Systems)
````

*Test file contents*

````
import org.json.JSONObject;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]){
       JSONObject jo = new JSONObject("{ \"abc\" : \"def\" }");
       System.out.println(jo.toString());
    }
}
````

*Execute the Test file*
```` 
java -cp .;json-java.jar Test (Windows)
java -cp .:json-java.jar Test (Unix Systems)
````

*Expected output*

````
{"abc":"def"}
````

 
**Tools to build the package and execute the unit tests**

Execute the test suite with Maven:
```
mvn clean test
```

Execute the test suite with Gradlew:

```
gradlew clean build test
```
